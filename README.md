# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issue

This repository demonstrates an issue with Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds. The expected gradient is not rendering correctly.  The solution provides a fix using a more explicit approach to defining the gradient.

## Bug Description

The initial code uses `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` to create a gradient background. However, this results in an unexpected output. The solution offers alternative implementation for consistent results.
